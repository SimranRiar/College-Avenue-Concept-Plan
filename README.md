# College-Avenue-Concept-Plan
Design project where I lay out my concept for a redeveloped College Avenue Campus

~2 years later:
Amatuer hour.
If I had to do this again, which I might do as part of a larger Urban Design portfolio presentation, I'd:

- use CSS grid layout for the pictures
          OR
- use Google's PDF Viewer
          OR
- use the PDF JS library.
